# Faculty_Demographics_using_SAS
Faculty demographics data provides basic information of the faculty profile. At an engineering institution, there are multiple departments in which faculty of different cadre are working as course facil itators. This demographic data can be represented at various levels through tables and charts for quick review and analysis using SAS Programming

I have uploaded the SAS code file with the output of the code in a PDF format.
Raw data is also uploaded in Excel format.
Demo files are uploaded if extra dataset is needed.
